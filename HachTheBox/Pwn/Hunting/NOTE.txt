I've hidden the flag very carefully, you'll never manage to find it! Please note that the goal is to find the flag, and not to obtain a shell.



MAIN: 0x56556560


munmap() and map():		(DO IT WITH SYSCALLS, NOT FUNCTION CALLINGs)
	if munmap() returns -1 then we go on and test next address
	else remap the address with mmap() and access to that range in order to find the flag
	
	We know the program's base address (RSI register contains infos) so from that we can
	calculate the end of program's mapped addresses.

	get_random_address() gets address between 0x60000000 and 0x7FFF0000.
	Addresses have length of 0x1000 so we need at most ~131k iterations to get flag's address.
