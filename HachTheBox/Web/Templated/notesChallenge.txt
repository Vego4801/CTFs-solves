The site is affected by SSTI (Server Side Template Injection):
The page renders the "404 page" with the searched page name as the parameter for the template.
This will lead to a simple injection with the following structure:

(<URL>/ is the URL of the page, the payload is the following instruction)
<URL>/{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls -al').read().

That's it, the job is done!
