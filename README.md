# ctfs-solves
A collection of almost all the CTF challenges I have solved in the past.

Over the years, I have changed my approach and (hopefully) improved my problem-solving skills, as well as my exploitation techniques.

Most of them are `pwn` because it is my favourite category and I am focusing on it more than any other category.

The idea behind this repository is mainly to keep track of everything I solve in order to brush up on some techniques or ideas I have used in the past, as well as to be of interest to anyone who comes across it.
