Solution: The program uses `system("/usr/bin/env echo and now what?");` to print the string.
		  "/usr/bin/env" ensures that echo is run using the path defined in PATH in the environment.
		  So we can define our own `echo` program (which will open the flag; it can be a binary or a
		  shell script, it doesn't matter) and modify PATH so that it will have the actual path ("./")
		  at the beginning.
		  This will ensure that the system searches in our actual directory first.
