Read the /home/flag04/flag.txt file.

Log in as level04 with password level04

Solution: To bypass this check we can simply create a symlink to the file in a writable
		  directory (ln -s /home/flag04/flag.txt /home/level04/bubba) such that the
		  symlink does not contain the string "flag.txt".
		  Then we can use the program to read from our symlink.
