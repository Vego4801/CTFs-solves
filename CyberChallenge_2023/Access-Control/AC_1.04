Read the /home/flag02/flag.txt file.

Log in as level02 with password level02

Solution: The program uses `getenv("USER")` to get the username from the environment and print it.
		  We can simply change $USER so that it contains the string "/bin/cat /home/flag02/flag.txt".
		  (e.g: PATH="Pizza; /bin/cat /home/flag02/flag.txt; /bin/echo ")
