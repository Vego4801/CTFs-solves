flag03 lets you write messages on the /home/flag03/messages.txt file in her home directory.
However, you can only access the file from a VIM instance she provides.

Find the flag file.

WARNING: VIM is hard.
WARNING 2: VIM is really hard.

Log in as level03 with password level03

Solution: VIM opens the "messages.txt" file, located in the "/home/flag03/" folder.
		  Since VIM is running with the flag03 Effective UID, we can open the VIM directory browser
		  in VIM normal mode.
		  With ":e ." we can list files in the "/home/level03/" folder and then navigate to the
		  "/home/flag03" folder and find the flag file ("FlAg.TxT").
		  We can also directly navigate to flag03 home by typing :e /home/flag03/ in VIM.
